      <p>Custom window treatments are the mark of a well-designed space, but no
        two windows have the same design needs. I can sew draperies, all styles
        of fabric shades, valances, cornices, and swags made to your exact
        specifications.</p>

      <p>If a couch or chair is beginning to look too worn, a slipcover is an
        easy, inexpensive way to update the look of your furniture. They’re
        easily removed, washable, and can be changed quickly to accommodate
        changes in decor. Your favorite old chair will look brand new.</p>

      <p>If it’s made from fabric, I can sew it. Bedding, decorative pillows,
        indoor and outdoor cushions, nursery items, table coverings, and pet
        beds are some of my clients’ most requested items. Decide what you
        want, and let’s get to work!</p>

    <p>I provide complete sewing services for homes and businesses in Reno,

      exactly to my clients’ specifications, so no two pieces are ever the
      same. And because my business is small and personal, I can provide

    <h2 class="col-head">About Me</h2>
    <p>I absolutely love to sew. I learned how when I was eight, while visiting
      my favorite aunt and uncle in Oregon. My aunt helped me sew a simple
      dress and I was hooked! I went on to sew prom dresses in high school and
      then, when I had my own home, made my own bedding and window treatments.</p>

    <p>My first career was working as an emergency room nurse, which I did for
      20 years. I loved that too, but the hours were strenuous and didn’t leave
      much time for me to spend with my four boys, who were very young at the
      time. I decided that I wanted to work from home so I could be around them
      more often, so I left my job and started my own sewing business! That was
      15 years ago, and I feel so lucky to have been able to be there for my
      family and still do what I love.</p>
